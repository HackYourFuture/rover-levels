  Oh no, it's dark now! I cannot see the obstacles, but they're still there. Fortunately,
  someone has given me the instructions to get to the flag.

  Above the code you see `const instructions = [(...)]`. You cannot see the contents of
  the instructions, but they're there.

  Use your knowledge so far to iterate through this array and execute the instructions inside.

  The instructions array contains strings, any of `'move'`, `'turn-left'` or `'turn-right'`. An
  *example* of an instructions array is `const instructions = ['move', 'turn-left', 'move']`.

  *Tips:*

  - Use a `for ... of` loop to iterate through the instructions
  - Use `console.log` to inspect each instruction when implementing your algorithm

        For some reason, you managed to reach the flag without iterating through the instructions.

        To get more stars, try to follow the assignment.

        Well done! Now, can you try to see if you can make it work with a `for ... of` loop?

        Great! You've used an `if` statement to check the instructions. Can you think of another
        control structure used to compare a value against multiple possibilities?
