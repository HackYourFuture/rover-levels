name: Arrays 1
instructions: |-
  In this level, part of the program has been written. This time, you should modify some arrays
  to get me to the flag.

  There are two arrays. I will use `stepsUp` to go up a few steps, and then `stepsRight` to go right
  a few steps, until both arrays are empty.

  So, the way it's set up now, I will:

  - Go up 1 step
  - Go right 1 step
  - Go up 4 steps

  Can you modify the arrays so that I will arrive at the flag? Note, you cannot change the *variables*
  as they're const, so you have to modify the arrays themselves.

  Read about arrays in [this MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).
