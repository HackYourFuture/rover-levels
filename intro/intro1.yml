  Hello! I'm Rover, I'm a robot. You can program me through JavaScript.
  I understand two commands, which are JavaScript functions:

  - `move()`
  - `turn(direction)`

  The second function takes one argument, which should be
  the direction to turn to (`'left'` or `'right'`).

  I cannot walk through obstacles (trees, water). Can you get
  me to the flag?

  *Tips:*

  - Press PLAY to see me move forward and turn to the right.
  - If you want to restart, use the RESTART button.
  - If your code contains an error, red circles will indicate where
    the error is. Click on it to get details.
  - To reset the code to the original code shown below, use the RESET
    button above.
