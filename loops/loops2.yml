name: While loops
instructions: |-
  Apart from `move()` and `turn(direction)`, there is one more function you can use,
  called `isFinished()`. It tells you when I've reached the flag.

  Use a `while` loop to make me move forward until I've reached the flag.

        Okay, you finished, but your program is too long, and you
        haven't used a `while` loop.

        To get three stars, use a `while` loop...

        Great, but try to use only three lines of code for your program...
