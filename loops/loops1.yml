  Alright, that was easy. Now I seem to be lost in an apple orchard (because I love apples).
  Of course, you can type out `move()` seven times, but the point of writing code is to
  not repeat yourself too often.

  Can you find a way using a `for` loop to get me to the flag *in only three lines of code*?

        Okay, you finished, but your program is too long, and you
        haven't used a `for` loop.

        To get three stars, use a `for` loop...
