  Alright, that was easy. Now I seem to be lost in an apple orchard (because I love apples).
  Of course, you can type out `move()` seven times, but the point of writing code is to
  not repeat yourself too often.

  I've written a `for` loop to make my own life easier. A `for` loop looks like this:

  ```javascript
  for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    doSomething();
  }
  ```

  In a later level, we'll take a closer look at the `for` loop, but for now remember that 
  **the value of N above determines how often the code `doSomething()` is repeated**.

  The for loop doesn't take me far enough. Can you change the code so that I reach the
  flag?

  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    move();

        Okay, you finished, but your program is too long, and you
        haven't used a `for` loop.

        To get three stars, use a `for` loop...
