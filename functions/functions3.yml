  Let's play some chess. The knight in chess [moves](http://www.chesscorner.com/tutorial/basic/knight/knight.htm)
  two places ahead, and then one to the left or right.
  
  Write a function called `knightMove` below which has a parameter called `direction`. The function should
  make me do a knight's move in the specified direction. If you do it right, the program will bring me to
  the flag.

  Note that I have to face the same way *after* the knight move as *before* the knight move, or it won't work.

  If you're lost, here's that [MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

        It seems you finished without implementing the `knightMove` function.

        To get three stars, make sure you've implemented this function.

        Your function does not accept an argument.

        To get three stars, make sure your `knightMove` function accepts an argument.

        It seems your code is too long. You can do it in less lines of code!

        Tip: can you find a way to use a conditional expression (`... ? ... : ...`) to turn the
        opposite way given a direction?
