name: Apples
instructions: |-
  In case I haven't mentioned it before, I really like apples. Let's take a small
  break and eat some. No complicated stuff yet, just make me eat the apples and get
  to the flag.

  You do not have to use `pickUp` for me to eat apples! I eat them anyway. That's
  just how much I like them.
