  Oh no, it's dark now! I cannot see the obstacles, but they're still there. Fortunately,
  someone has given me the instructions to get to the flag.

  Above the code you see `const instructions = [(...)]`. You cannot see the contents of
  the instructions, but they're there.

  The instructions themselves are all *functions*, so you can just call them, e.g. this will
  execute the first instruction:
  
  ```
  const firstInstruction = instructions[0];
  firstInstruction();
  ```

  *Tips:*

  - Use the `for ... of` loop, or the `.forEach` function with an arrow function or to iterate
    through the instructions!

        For some reason, you managed to reach the flag without iterating through the instructions.

        To get more stars, try to follow the assignment.

        Well done! Now, can you try to see if you can make it work with a `for ... of` loop, or
        by using the `.forEach` function?

        Great! You've used an `if` statement to check the instructions. Can you think of another
        control structure used to compare a value against multiple possibilities?
