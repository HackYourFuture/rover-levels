name: Variables 2
instructions: |-
  Just like in the last level, two variables are used by the code that is already written. It's your
  job to *declare* (create) those variables.

  Look at the code below, figure out which variables you will have to declare, and what their values
  should be.

  Read up on variables on [this MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables).

rows:    4
columns: 4

start: [0, 3, 'up']
goal:  [3, 0]

items:
  - [1, 1, 'tree']
  - [1, 2, 'tree']
  - [1, 3, 'tree']
  - [2, 1, 'tree']
  - [2, 2, 'apple']
  - [2, 3, 'tree']
  - [3, 1, 'tree']
  - [3, 2, 'tree']
  - [3, 3, 'tree']

initialCode: |-
  // Declare your variables here:

  // ---- You cannot modify these lines

  for (let i = 0; i < stepsUp; i++) {
    move();
  }
  turn('right');
  for (let i = 0; i < stepsRight; i++) {
    move();
  }

  // ++++

        You have used `var` to declare your variables. Nowadays, we encourage programmers to use
        `let` or `const`.
        
        Do you know which of the two to use?

        Great, but think about whether you should use `let` or `const`. Are the values of your
        variables ever going to change after you've initialized them?
