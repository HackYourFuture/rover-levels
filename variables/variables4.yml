  So, a key is actually a variable. When you call `unlock(key);` you use the
  key to unlock the lock.

  The lock can only be unlocked with a specific value. In the previous level,
  the key had the value `true` and the door could be unlocked with the value `true`,
  so using `unlock(key);` worked in the previous level. (If you go back, to the
  previous level, you'll see that `unlock(true);` would have also worked).

  The lock in this level is a bit more difficult. They key in this level is a
  *number*, and the lock can also be unlocked with a *number*. However, the
  number to unlock the lock is *double* the number of the key. So, if the key is `8`,
  the lock can be unlocked with the number `16`.

  How would you write your code to unlock the lock in this level?

  *Tip:*

  - Click on the lock to see how you can unlock it, given the value of the key.
