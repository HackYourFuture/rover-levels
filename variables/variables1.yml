name: Variables 1
instructions: |-
  Let's try something new. A part of the code has already been written, and you have to
  help out to make it work.

  In the code, two variables are used: `stepsDown` and `stepsLeft`, but they don't have
  the correct values. Write code to give the variables the right values so that the
  code works.

  Read up on variables on [this MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables).

  *Tip:*

  - If you want to see *all* JavaScripts steps that are executed, not only the ones that move the robot,
    activate the VERBOSE switch at the top right of the screen.
