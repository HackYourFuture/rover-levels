  Oh hello! What is this, a lock? And a key? Very clichÃ©!

  As you probably guessed, you need to key to open the lock. So, move to the key,
  and pick it up with the command `pickUp()`. This function `return`s the key,
  so you will have to write it like `const key = pickUp();`.

  When you arrive at the lock, you can unlock it by typing `unlock(key);` when
  facing the lock.
